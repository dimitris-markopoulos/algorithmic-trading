# Algorithmic Trading

*This is an evolving collection of trading models where I continuously build and refine machine learning pipelines for market prediction.*

Each folder is a self-contained strategy with modular code and full backtesting support.

## Pipelines

- `SVM_pipeline/` – SVM classifier with macro features and time-series CV  
- `x4_pipeline/` – 4-model ensemble (LR, RF, XGBoost, LGBM); fixed parameters used to avoid overfitting from excessive tuning

## Usage

Each folder includes its own `README.md` and `requirements.txt`. Run independently.
